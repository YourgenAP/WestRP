[ citizen-server-impl] -- [server notice: hostname_rework]
[ citizen-server-impl] You don't have sv_projectName/sv_projectDesc set.
[ citizen-server-impl] These variables augment sv_hostname and fix your server name being cut off in the server list.
[ citizen-server-impl] Use `sets sv_projectName ..` and `sets sv_projectDesc ..` to set them.
